    "# DATABASE STRUCTURE\n",
    "This sample database is designed to organize information about Ewha Womans University. The structure of the database with columns like \"title,\" \"heading,\" \"content,\" and \"token\" serves a specific purpose in the context of using OpenAI's models for natural language processing tasks. Let's break down the significance of each column:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Title:\n",
    "Represents the title of a specific entry. This column helps identify and categorize different pieces of information in the database.\n",
    "### Heading:\n",
    "Represents the heading of a specific sections within each entry. This column can provide additional context or organization within each entry.\n",
    "### Content:\n",
    "Contains the main textual content or information associated with each entry. It includes detailed descriptions, requirements, or any other relevant information about the topic. This is the text that will be processed by the GPT-3.5-turbo model to tokenize it, and OpenAI's Completion and Embedding APIs to generate responses, answer questions, or perform other natural language tasks.\n",
    "### Token:\n",
    "Stores the precalculated token count for the corresponding \"content\" of each entry. Tokens are chunks of text that language models like GPT-3 process. The token count is essential because OpenAI charges per token for model usage. Understanding the token count allows us to manage and control costs when interacting with OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In summary, this structure facilitates efficient data management and effective use of the language model for natural language understanding and generation tasks."
